# Nand2Tetris

This project contains project codes learnt from the self-paced course [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course).

### Project 1: Boolean Logic Gates

Focuses on the basic boolean logic gates. For example, XOR, OR and AND gates, which are the fundamental building blocks. 

**How to navigate the project:**

1. The boolean table for each logic gate can be found in the related `.cmp` files.
2. The hardware description language (HDL) can be found in the related `.hdl` files.
3. The test scripts are found in the `.tst` files. To run them, download the related project software tools and run the `./HardwareSimulator.sh` file, click on "Load Script" and select the related `.tst` file.


### Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic Gates

Focuses on the arithmetic logic gates. For example, a basic ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) that does basic arithmetic and logic operations in the CPU, which contains as well a CU (Control Unit) that directs the operation of the processor for the ALUs (e.g. what to compute).
